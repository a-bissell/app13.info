<p>Hi, nerd.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><b>So what exactly goes on here?</b></p>

<p>Well besides assaulting my users and centering text, not a whole lot.<br>
I am focused on having this website be as fast as possible, since a lot of people<br>
who want to access this site don't really have fast internet, or are at school, or something.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><b>What's with the ads?</b></p>

<p>Short answer: This crap 'aint free.<br>
Long answer: In order to host this website and keep it quick I need to<br>
pay for it, and I am quite poor. Therefore I have a single ad on the homepage.<br>
As soon I reach the months quota, I take the ad down. Also I have a "Donate" button, if you are<br>
feeling extra awesome.</p>
